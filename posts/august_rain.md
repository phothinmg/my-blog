This lake is especially precious during those gentle rainstorms in August. Imagine this: the air and water are perfectly still, the sky is overcast, and mid-afternoon has the serene calmness of evening. The wood-thrushes are singing their beautiful songs, echoing from shore to shore. Itâ€™s in these quiet intervals that the lake becomes truly mesmerizing.

At such times, the lake is never smoother. The clear portion of the air above is shallow and darkened by clouds, making the water below appear as if it's filled with light and reflections. It feels like a lower heaven, turning the lake into something even more significant and awe-inspiring.
