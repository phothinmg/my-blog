When I moved to the pond, I knew I wanted to make reading a big part of my daily routine. There’s no better way to unwind after a day of building, foraging, or just exploring the woods. Plus, without the distractions of city life, I’ve found that I can really immerse myself in the stories and ideas I’m reading about.

My tiny house has a cozy reading nook right by a large window that overlooks the pond. It’s the perfect spot to curl up with a good book and a cup of tea. The natural light during the day is fantastic, and at night, I light a few candles to create a warm, inviting atmosphere.
