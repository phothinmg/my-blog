The interior is cozy and functional, designed to make the most of the small space. I’ve got a loft bed that looks out over the pond, a compact kitchen with a wood-burning stove, and plenty of storage built into the walls. I even managed to create a little reading nook by a large window where I can sit and watch the world go by.

Living in this house has been an incredible experience. It’s small, but it has everything I need, and being so close to nature has been incredibly grounding. Every morning, I wake up to the sound of birds and the sight of the sun rising over the water. It’s a constant reminder of why I chose this path.

Building this house was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but also one of the most rewarding. If you’re thinking about pursuing a similar dream, my advice is to go for it.
